          <h2 id="personal-like">💖 Why I Personally Like This Breed</h2>
          <p>I like the Burmese cat because of its lively personality and emotional connection with people. It’s the kind of cat that feels like a companion rather than just a pet, always curious and always close.</p>

          <h1 class="section-title">Personality & Behavior</h1>
          <p class="section-text">The Burmese’s sweet and gentle nature makes her an ideal companion and pet. Burmese cats are playful and love to be with people, and are also patient and social with children and other pets. While they tend to be fairly quiet, they will “talk” with soft, chirping voices. They enjoy attention, and want to be where their people are, helping with whatever activity is happening.</p>

          <h1 class="section-title">Characteristics</h1>
          <p class="section-text">Their compact body is solid and muscular with a rounded head and sweet, expressive eyes. Their ears are medium sized, with rounded tips that tilt slightly forward.</p>

          <h1 class="section-title">Lifespan</h1>
          <p class="section-text">10 to 16 years</p>

          <h1 class="section-title">Colors</h1>
          <p class="section-text">The original Burmese cat was sable, a solid, dark brown color. Newer lines of Burmese come in several other shades, including blue, champagne and platinum, and some associations even permit tortoiseshell, lilac and red to be shown. Sable kittens’ coats darken as they mature and all colors have green or golden eyes, depending on their coat color.</p>

          <h1 class="section-title">Shedding</h1>
          <p class="section-text">Shedding is minimal and weekly brushing will keep your Burmese cat’s coat healthy and shiny by removing loose hair and redistributing skin oils.</p>

          <h1 class="section-title">Health</h1>
          <p class="section-text">Burmese cats are prone to gingivitis and are sensitive to anesthesia. Other diseases and deformities have been seen in the breed.</p>

          <h1 class="section-title">Facts</h1>
          <ul id="fun-facts">
              <li>The Burmese cat resulted from a cross of the Siamese with the “copper cat” of Burma (present-day Myanmar).</li>
              <li>They may have been kept by priests in temples and palaces.</li>
              <li>The Burmese was one of the original breeds accepted by TICA.</li>
