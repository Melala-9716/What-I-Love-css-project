          <h1 class="section-title">Temperament</h1>
          <p class="section-text">The Birman’s sweet and gentle nature makes her an ideal companion and pet. Birmans are playful and love to be with people, and are also patient and social with children and other pets.
          While Birmans tend to be fairly quiet, they will “talk” with soft, chirping voices. They enjoy attention, and want to be where their people are, helping with whatever activity is happening. </p>

          <h1 class="section-title">Characteristics</h1>
          <p class="section-text">The most recognizable characteristics of adult Maine Coon cats are their large size and long, bushy tail. Their paws are big and well-tufted to be suitable for walking in snow, as can be seen in both adult and kitten Maine Coon cats. In addition, their ears are tufted, often with points of hair at the tips.</p>

          <h1 class="section-title">Lifespan</h1>
          <p class="section-text">10 to 13 years</p>

          <h1 class="section-title">Colors</h1>
          <p class="section-text">The most common color for Maine Coon cats is brown tabby. However, they can be nearly any color and pattern. Their eye colors, too, have a wide range from blue to green to gold, and can include odd-eyes (i.e. two different colored eyes).</p>

          <h1 class="section-title">Shedding</h1>
          <p class="section-text">The coat of a Maine Coon cat is shorter on the shoulders and longer on the stomach. It’s smooth, shaggy and sheds moderately, though not more than other breeds with plush coats. While they do require frequent grooming, Main Coon cats love attention so they typically don’t mind being brushed.</p>

          <h1 class="section-title">Health</h1>
          <p class="section-text">Maine Coon cats are generally a hardy breed of cat. They’re built for enduring cold, harsh New England winters. Maine Coons can suffer from hip dysplasia, with the abnormality affecting the larger males more than females.</p>

          <h1 class="section-title">Facts</h1>
          <ul id="fun-facts">
              <li>In 1985, this all-American breed became the official state cat of Maine.</li>
              <li>The winner of the first cat show in North America, at Madison Square Garden in 1895, was a Maine Coon cat.</li>
              <li>The Maine Coon is not a cross between a cat and a raccoon.</li>
          </ul>
